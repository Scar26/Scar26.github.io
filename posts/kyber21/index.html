<div class=post-content>
<p>This is an author writeup for the cryptography challenge &ldquo;Beyond the mountain&rdquo; that I created for Backdoor CTF 2021-22. It was based on a backdoor allowing controlled decryption failures that I created for a reduced version of <a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8406610>kyber</a>. What I personally found interesting in this challenge while creating it was that the attack (atleast as per the intended solution) is based on a technique I personally have yet to see used in any academic work but is very popular in the cryptography CTF community. That technique being, RKM&rsquo;s legendary <a href=https://github.com/rkm0959/Inequality_Solving_with_CVP>Inequality solving with CVP</a> repo</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll begin with an introduction of the Kyber Cryptosystem, followed by the challenge and finally the attack</p>
<h2 id=notation>Notation</h2>
<p>$Z_q$ represents the ring of integers mod q.</p>
<p>$R_q = Z_q[X]/(X^N + 1)$ for N some power of 2. The ring of $l_1 \times l_2$ matrices over $R_q$ is written as $R_q^{l_1 \times l_2}$</p>
<p>For $x \in Z_q^n$, $||x||_2$ denotes the $l_2$ norm of $x$. For $x \in R_q$, $||x||_2$ denotes the $l_2$ norm of $x$ considered as a vector of its coefficients</p>
<p>Similarly $||x||$ = $max({|x_i|\ | x_i \in x})$ denotes the $l_{\infty{}}$ norm of x.</p>
<p>$U(S)$ denotes the uniformly random distribution over the set $S$.
$\chi(S)$ represents small error distribution over the set S (well, technically it has to be a Poset but that&rsquo;s a given for the rings we&rsquo;re working with)</p>
<h2 id=background>Background</h2>
<p>CRYSTALS-Kyber is a Module LWE based PKE scheme that, at the time of writing, is one of finalist candidates in the NIST Post Quantum competition.</p>
<h3 id=mod-lwe>Mod LWE</h3>
<p>The LWE (Learning with Errors) problem is an extension of the LPN (Learning Parity with Noise) problem and is described as follows.</p>
<p>For a random secret vector $s \in Z_q^n$, the adversary is given an aribitrary number of samples of the form
$$(a, a^Ts + e) \in Z_q^n \times Z_q$$ $$a \leftarrow U(Z_q^n), e \leftarrow \chi(Z_q)$$</p>
<p>The LWE problem is then to obtain $s$ from the given samples. Under the LWE assumption, this problem assumed to be hard.</p>
<p>For <strong>Ring LWE</strong>, $Z_q$ is replaced with $R_q$. So $a, s, e \in R_q$ and the samples are of the form
$$(a, a.s + e) \in R_q \times R_q$$</p>
<p>Finally, for <strong>Module LWE</strong>, $s, a \in R_q^{l \times 1}$, i.e a module of $R_q$ leading to samples of the form
$$(a, a^Ts + e) \in R_q^{l \times 1} \times R_q$$</p>
<h3 id=lwe-based-encryption>LWE based encryption</h3>
<p>The complete functioning of Kyber is explained in the next section. However I&rsquo;d like to preface it with a simple Ring-LWE based encryption <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/293>scheme</a> that highlights the core intuition behind a number of LWE PKEs</p>
